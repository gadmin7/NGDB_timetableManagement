# Problem Statement: Optimizing Timetable Management for College

**Key Objectives:**

1. **Teacher Timetable:** Create a system that generates individual timetables for faculty members, indicating which courses they are teaching and when.

2. **Class Timetable:** Develop class-wise timetables that display the schedule for each class, including courses, room assignments, and timings.

3. **HOD's Consolidated Timetable:** Implement a consolidated timetable for the Head of Department(HOD) that shows the allocation of teachers to classes and courses.

4. **Optimization Algorithms:** Integrate optimization algorithms to allocate resources (faculty and classrooms) based on demand, availability, and scheduling constraints.

5. **Real-time Updates:** Ensure that the system accommodates real-time updates, including unexpected resource unavailability and changes in faculty schedules.
